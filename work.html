            <h3>Sportsman’s Warehouse – Part-Time Sales Assistant</h3>
            <p>
                I worked part-time at <strong>Sportsman’s Warehouse</strong> for two years,
                where I developed strong <strong>customer service</strong>, <strong>communication</strong>,
                and <strong>teamwork</strong> skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                This role helped me improve my ability to work under pressure, manage time effectively,
                and communicate clearly with customers and colleagues — skills that are highly transferable
                to software development environments.
